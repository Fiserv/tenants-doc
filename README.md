## The Studio Community (Metaphor)

The way we describe the Developer Studio is that it is a apartment complex and each of you are tenants within the complex. (hint: Still not sure what a tenant is? Checkout the [glossary](glossary.md#tenant--product))

While we, the DevStudio team, are the HOA.

### What can you do as a Tenant

Just like how you move into your apartment you can bring along your furniture (your content) and decorate your apartment (within limits dedicated by the HOA (i.e. DevStudio team)).

1. You create/edit/publish your own documentation and APIs at your liesure
2. You can provide your own live sandbox
3. You can provide your own API management system. Check out our docs on [Enabling Workspaces](enable-workspaces.md).

### What must you do as a Tenant

Because the Developer Studio is meant to unify all our products under a single portal that means there are guidelines you must follow.

1. You must provide [Basic Tenant Information](tenant-basics.md) such as name, desctiption, business type, product tags, etc.
2. You must have API documentation in [markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and for that use our [Markdown syntax](https://developer.fiserv.com/support/docs/?path=docs/md/extended-syntax.md)
3. You must have a [getting started section](update-productpage-content.md#introduction)
4. You must be on Openapi specification 3.0+
5. You must have Release Notes as part of the documentation that follow our [guidelines](release-notes-guidelines.md)

Hint: When in doubt look at [Commerce Hub](https://developer.fiserv.com/product/CommerceHub) as an example of what to do.

### What can you NOT do as a Tenant

There is pretty little you cannot do. If you're not sure, shoot us a message using our [Support](https://github.com/fiserv/support/issues) or through our [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A65e0590efd7f4f1294553542e1b9a742%40thread.tacv2/Feedback%20and%20Help!?groupId=982cd560-8afd-42fc-bb4c-543e1989b6b1&tenantId=11873a1f-4c8d-450d-8dfb-e37a2e2557f8).

All API yaml files must contain a version number so that the right yaml is fetched when user selects a certain version. The same version number must be referenced in the `tenant.json` file
   * .Docignore: File containing list of files to be ignored by our indexing/webhook services (even if they are located in one of the aforementioned directories). Useful for hosting internal How-to and documentation for your other team members.
